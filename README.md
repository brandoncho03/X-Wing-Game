# X-Wing-Game
Inspired by flappy bird and space invaders

I originally found this video on YouTube to learn about game development in JavaScript: https://youtu.be/jj5ADM2uywg

It was a stepping stone for me to become familiar with JavaScript and see how game development is implemented. I originally copied the code and tweaked some lines in order to learn and understand.

After this process, I wanted to tweak the code and make my own version. I am a huge Star Wars fan and I decided to give it a different theme with varying gameplay. My plan was to have a game similar to Space Invaders where I can move my ship (in this case an X-Wing) in order to avoid pipes.

I made my own pipe and X-Wing sprites and found a matching background and sprite as well as sound effects and music. As a video game lover, I had a lot of fun playtesting and adding the different features. I was able to apply what I learned YouTube and my own personal experience to my own video game. Although a small game, I am positive it will be a great start for me to pursue larger projects in the future.
